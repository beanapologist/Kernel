# Eigenverse — Overview

## What is Eigenverse?

**Canonical repository: [github.com/beanapologist/Eigenverse](https://github.com/beanapologist/Eigenverse)**

**Eigenverse** is a fully formal, machine-checked library of theorems built
around a single central object: the critical eigenvalue
**μ = exp(i·3π/4)** — a point on the complex unit circle whose 8-cycle orbit,
coherence function C(r) = 2r/(1+r²), and Silver ratio δS = 1+√2 generate a
complete, self-consistent map from pure mathematics to observable physical
reality.

Every statement is verified by the [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/)
type-checker; there are **zero `sorry` placeholders** anywhere in the codebase.

This means that if Lean accepts a proof, the theorem is *logically guaranteed*
to follow from the stated axioms — no hand-waving, no gaps.

## Scope

| Domain | Key Results | Theorems |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Algebra** | Critical eigenvalue μ = exp(I·3π/4), 8-cycle closure μ⁸=1, Silver ratio δS=1+√2, coherence function C(r), Z/8Z rotational memory | 127 |
| **Geometry** | Rotation matrix R(3π/4): det=1, orthogonal, order-8 orbit; unit circle S¹ orbit; hyperbolic Pythagorean identity C²+tanh²=1; space-time map F(s,t)=t+i·s | 141 |
| **Physics** | c=1/√(μ₀ε₀), fine structure constant α≈1/137, Koide mass formula, Lorentz geometry, Navier-Stokes turbulence bounds | 159 |
| **Quantum** | Floquet time crystals, gravity-quantum duality, Theorem Q quantization arms, forward classical time, bidirectional time & Planck floor | 120 |
| **Chemistry** | NIST 2016 atomic weights, isotopic abundances, Ohm-coherence duality G·R=1, triality-scale coherence | 44 |
| **Total** | | **450** |

> **Note:** The crypto-application modules (`PumpFunBot`, `EthereumTradingBot`,
> `CrossChainDeFiAggregator`, `CryptoBridge`) live in `formal-lean/` for
> reference but are not part of the Eigenverse mathematical library.

## Design Principles

1. **Zero sorry** — every proof compiles without axiom bypasses.
2. **Mathlib grounded** — all arithmetic, linear algebra, and analysis
   reasoning is delegated to [Mathlib4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4).
3. **Modular** — each domain is an independent `formal-lean/*.lean` file;
   `src/` organises them by topic for downstream consumers.
4. **NIST-anchored** — numerical constants (atomic weights, isotopic
   compositions, fundamental constants) are taken directly from official
   NIST publications.
5. **Extensible** — adding a new theorem requires only a new `.lean` file
   and a line in `lakefile.lean`; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
cd formal-lean/
lake exe cache get   # download pre-built Mathlib cache (~5 min)
lake build           # build all modules
lake exe formalLean  # print summary of verified theorems
```
